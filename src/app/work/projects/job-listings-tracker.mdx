## Overview

This project is a personal job-search pipeline tracker designed to reduce friction in capturing job listings and managing applications. It keeps everything in one place so I can move from discovery to application to follow-up without losing context.

## Problem

Job searching involves scattered data:

- Job postings are spread across platforms
- Roles have inconsistent formatting and missing details
- It is easy to lose track of what was applied, what needs tailoring, and when to follow up

## Solution

A structured tracking system that:

- Captures job listings into a single database
- Normalizes core fields into a consistent schema
- Tracks application status and next actions
- Enables quick filtering by role, company, location, and priority

## Architecture

**Pipeline**

1. Job listing captured (manual entry or automated ingestion)
2. Normalization layer maps raw listing data into a consistent schema
3. Status tracking updates as the application progresses
4. Follow-up reminders and notes keep the pipeline actionable

**Core schema**

- Company, Role, Location, Link
- Source, Date added
- Status (Saved, Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected)
- Priority, Notes, Next action, Follow-up date

## Tech Stack

- Central store: Airtable or Google Sheets
- Automation layer: n8n (planned or implemented)
- Optional enrichment: GPT for role summarization and fit notes

## Results

- Reduced time spent context-switching across tabs and sources
- Faster application turnaround by keeping next steps visible
- Cleaner decision-making with consistent status and priority fields

## What’s next

- Auto-ingestion from LinkedIn and job boards via email parsing and saved searches
- GPT-based resume tailoring checklist per role
- Automated follow-up reminders and calendar blocks
