## Overview

This project is a GenAI-powered travel planning assistant built on Kore.ai. It supports both new and repeat users, extracts travel preferences from free-form input, and generates structured destination and itinerary outputs.

## Problem

Travel planning typically requires multiple back-and-forth steps to collect preferences, confirm constraints, and create an itinerary. Traditional bots struggle with ambiguous user inputs and frequently break when entity extraction is unreliable.

## Solution

A Kore.ai bot architecture that uses Generative AI to:

- Extract preferences from natural language (destination, budget, travel type, dates, interests)
- Personalize outputs using historical context for repeat users
- Generate destinations and itineraries using reusable components
- Handle edge cases with structured JSON prompt contracts and session persistence

## Architecture

**Core flows**

- NewConsumerFlow: end-to-end onboarding and itinerary generation
- RepeatedUserFlow: preference extraction + personalization using past travel context

**Reusable components**

1. Entities Extractor
   - GenAI prompt node + interpretation + script extraction
   - Stores results in `context.extractedEntities` and persists via session storage

2. Destination Generator
   - Generates destination options from extracted preferences
   - Injects historical data for repeat users when available

3. Itinerary Formatter
   - Generates a structured TRIP-format itinerary
   - Supports dynamic itinerary refinement (modify a single day without rewriting everything)

**Reliability improvements**

- Structured JSON-style system context for consistent extraction
- Session persistence across dialog tasks
- Replaced unreliable regex routing with GenAI-based intent extraction

## Tech Stack

- Kore.ai XO Platform (dialog tasks, entity extraction, routing)
- Generative AI nodes (prompting + structured output)
- Bot scripts for entity/session persistence
- n8n (workflow ideas for future automation extensions)

## Results

- More reliable entity extraction across ambiguous user inputs
- Reusable architecture across new and repeat user flows
- Faster iteration by standardizing prompt contracts and storage patterns

## What’s next

- Itinerary Comparison Tool
- Booking support and modification flows
- External integrations: flights/hotels/local experiences
