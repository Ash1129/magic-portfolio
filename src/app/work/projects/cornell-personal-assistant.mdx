### Demo

[**Cornell Personal Assistant**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7359563269394632705/?originTrackingId=dEHmluVKTPS5qflUu2NU1A%3D%3D)

## Overview

I’m building a personal assistant system inspired by multi-agent orchestration patterns. The Core Orchestrator interprets natural language, routes tasks to specialized agents, and stores long-term memory in PostgreSQL.

## Problem

Managing classes, deadlines, reminders, job search tasks, and workflows across tools (Calendar, email, notes, trackers) creates constant context switching and missed tasks.

## Solution

A Core Orchestrator Agent that:

- Extracts intent and entities from user requests
- Routes to specialized agents (Calendar, Email, Finance, Weather & News, Research, Content Creation)
- Stores and retrieves memory from PostgreSQL
- Generates structured outputs that sync into tools like Notion

## Architecture

**Flow**

1. User request → Core Orchestrator (GPT)
2. Orchestrator outputs `{ intent, entities, next_agent }`
3. Specialized agent runs actions (API calls, summaries, plans)
4. Results are saved to memory (PostgreSQL) and pushed to downstream tools (Notion)

**Key design choices**

- Modular agents so each workflow remains maintainable
- Strong prompt contracts for predictable JSON outputs
- Memory layer for continuity across sessions

## Tech Stack

- OpenAI API (routing + reasoning)
- n8n (workflow automation)
- PostgreSQL (memory)
- Google Calendar
- Notion

## Results

- Reduced manual weekly planning overhead
- More consistent follow-through via structured action plans

## What’s next

- Email triage agent
- Weather & News daily digest
- Resume and job-search automations
