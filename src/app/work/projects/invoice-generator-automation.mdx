### Demo

[**Invoice Generator Automation**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashwinprajeeth_agenticai-aiworkflow-automationtools-activity-7354429727853498371-LvS8)

## Overview

This project automates invoice creation and delivery for freelancers and small teams. Instead of manually formatting invoices, exporting PDFs, and sending emails, the workflow generates a branded invoice PDF from structured data, emails it to the client, and logs everything in a tracker for follow-up and bookkeeping.

## Problem

Manual invoicing is repetitive and error-prone:

- Copying values into templates leads to mistakes
- PDFs are generated inconsistently across clients
- Tracking sent, paid, and overdue invoices becomes messy
- Follow-ups are often missed

## Solution

A workflow that turns structured invoice inputs into a complete invoice lifecycle:

- Collect invoice fields (client, line items, taxes, due date)
- Generate a PDF invoice using PDFMonkey
- Send the invoice automatically via Gmail SMTP
- Store the PDF + metadata in Airtable
- Optionally store files in Google Drive for centralized access

## Architecture

**Flow**

1. Trigger: new invoice request (Form / Airtable / webhook)
2. Validate + normalize invoice data (totals, currency, taxes)
3. PDF generation (PDFMonkey template) → returns PDF URL
4. Email delivery (Gmail SMTP) with PDF attached or linked
5. Storage:
   - Airtable record (status, invoice number, client, due date)
   - Attachment stored via public URL
   - Optional Google Drive upload + link saved back to Airtable

**Key design choices**

- Template-driven PDF generation for consistent branding
- Central tracking table so you always know invoice status
- Modular design so it can be reused for payment reminders

## Tech Stack

- n8n (workflow orchestration)
- PDFMonkey (PDF generation template)
- Gmail SMTP (invoice delivery)
- Airtable (invoice tracker)
- Google Drive (optional storage)

## Results

- Faster invoice turnaround (generate + send in minutes)
- Fewer manual errors through structured inputs
- Clear tracking of invoices (sent, paid, overdue) in one place

## What’s next

- Overdue payment reminder automation
- Payment status updates via Stripe/PayPal webhooks
- Lightweight client portal or frontend UI
